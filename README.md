# ALX Backend User Data

This repository hosts projects focused on secure handling and processing of user data in backend systems. It covers key concepts in data protection, such as authentication, password encryption, and secure logging practices.

## Project: Personal Data Security and Authentication

### Overview
This project is part of the ALX Backend User Data series and aims to provide a solid foundation in managing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) securely in backend systems. Key features include:

- **PII Obfuscation**: Ensures sensitive data is masked in logs.
- **Password Encryption**: Uses bcrypt for hashing and validating passwords.
- **Secure Database Authentication**: Utilizes environment variables to protect database credentials.

### Learning Objectives
Upon completion, you will be able to:
1. Identify and distinguish between PII and non-PII data.
2. Implement logging filters to obfuscate PII fields.
3. Encrypt and validate passwords securely with bcrypt.
4. Configure secure database connections using environment variables.

### Project Requirements
- **Start Date**: Nov 5, 2024, 7:00 PM
- **Deadline**: Nov 7, 2024, 7:00 PM
- **Code Review**:
